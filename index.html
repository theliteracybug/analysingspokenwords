		<div>SUMMARY
</div>
		<div>water
</div>
		<div>Water can be used as a noun, such as the substance called water.

It can also be used as a verb, such as in “watering” a plant.
It can be used as an adjective, such as in “watery eyes”. In the latter two instances, you can see how morphology comes into play (e.g. the -ing and the -y suffixes, which show verb tense and parts of speech).

It is a two-syllable word, and the syllable break is consistent with known syllable rules. For instance, the word has a single consonant in the middle of the word, and  - therefore - the syllalbe break comes before this consontant and after the first vowel.

The letter-sound correspondences are relevatively consistent with known words. However, according to general pronunciation patterns, one may anticipate that the “a” would make its short sound, as in cat. That said, it is common for the “a” to make the “aw” sound when appearing after a “w”, as in “wash” or “watch”. This word also includes an r-controlled vowel, as in the “er” sound. (Trivia: What happens when a simple “i” is added to make “waiter”?)

		<div>Logical Workflow </div>
		<div>With plenty of practice, learners are able to gain a grasp of the alphabetic principle and of spellng, including the rules that help one proficiently write and pronounce words.
As learners recognise more and more words, it is easier to return greater attention to meaning, including both the meaning of individual words as well as sentences and texts. </div>
		<div>In order to ‘sound out” a word, one must possess strong phonemic awareness skills. Learners need to be able to divide words into syllables and syllables into individual sounds.
Over time, learners develop an understanding of the possible sounds in their language, also known as phonemic knowledge.</div>
